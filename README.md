# Optimal Customer Delivery Plan Project
Welcome to the repository for the Optimal Customer Delivery Plan project developed for the Supply Chain Lab course at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This project entails the creation of a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to tackle a complex problem in the realm of supply chain logistics, specifically focusing on optimizing customer delivery plans.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to build a series of programs, precisely four, each aiming to solve a particular aspect of the case study provided. The case revolves around devising the most efficient plan for customer deliveries, a critical component in supply chain management and logistics. The focus here is on the implementation and solutions provided in the third notebook, which addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a fundamental challenge in achieving optimal delivery routes.

## Key Features
- **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**: Utilizes MILP techniques to find the optimal solution for the VRP, ensuring efficient route planning for customer deliveries.
- **Optimization**: Focuses on minimizing the total distance traveled while meeting all customer demands and adhering to vehicle capacity constraints.
- **Scalability**: Demonstrates how the model can be scaled for different scenarios, including varying number of vehicles and customer demand levels.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Examines how changes in parameters affect the overall solution, aiding in understanding the robustness of the proposed plan.
